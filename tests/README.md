No automated tests yet. Manual checks:
- Attachments: Common and Spirit-code folders are picked correctly for both multi- and single-email drafts.
- Single-email attachments: independent root/enable on Lookup tab.
- Forward capture: select an email in Outlook, capture, and confirm body/attachments appear in drafts alongside app attachments.
